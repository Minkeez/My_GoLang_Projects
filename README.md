# My GoLang Projects (0 to Hero)
Welcome to my **"0 to Hero"** GoLang portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects that showcase my learning journey in GoLang -- from the basic to more advanced topics. Each project resides in its own folder, along with relevant documentation and code.

### Overview
This repository is a collection of 100+ **GoLang projects**, each focusing on different concepts, techniques, and applications in GoLang. The aim is to:
- **Learn by Doing:** Demonstrate incremental growth in GoLang programming skills.
- **Explore Various Domains:** From simple CLI applications to web services, databases, concurrency, networking, and beyond.
- **Build a Portfolio:** Showcase each project to demonstrate progression, depth, and expertise.

### Repository Structure
Each project is contained in a separate folder with its own name and number, for example:
```
My_GoLang_Projects/
├── 01_Hello_World_CLI/
│   ├── main.go
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 02_Simple_Calculator/
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── 03_TODO_List_CLI/
├── 04_...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md  <-- (this file)
└── ...
```

Within each project's folder:
- `main.go` (or similarly named script) contains the main code.

- `README.md` gives details specific to that project (usage, requirements, etc.).

- Additional files or folders (e.g., `go.mod`, `config.json`, `database.db`, etc.) may exist as needed.

### Project List
1. **01_Hello_World_CLI**
   _A simple CLI application that prints "Hello, World!".._
2. **02_Simple_Calculator**
   _A basic arithmetic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division._
3. ...
   _And so on, until we reach 100+ projects!_

As I complete each project, I will update this list with a title, summary, and link to the subfolder.
